# Music-Sessions
This is a web app in which people can collectively listen to music through sessions.
The host logs in using Spotify (and Apple Music in the future), and this creates a session. 
Users will be able to join the session through QR codes or regular codes, and then users can add music to the queue.

Currently deployed <a href="https://musicsessions.tech/">here</a>!

NOTE: I am currently in the process of getting a API quota extension from Spotify. If you are unable to login, it means I have not gotten that extension yet!
If you would still like to use it, feel free to contact me with your spotify email and I can add you to the whitelist!
