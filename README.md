# Music-Sessions
This is a web app in which people can collectively listen to music through sessions.
The host logs in using Spotify (and Apple Music in the future), and this creates a session. 
Users will be able to join the session through QR codes or regular codes, and then users can add music to the queue.

This app is a work in progress :)
